# High-Level Documentation

### Overview
The provided code/data is a **binary file in the WebP image format**. It starts with the classic `RIFF` file signature and includes `WEBP` and `VP8` (referring to the lossy compression codec used in WebP images). This binary block encodes an image, not a conventional codebase with functions, classes, or logical programming flow.

### Purpose
- **Stores an image** in WebP format.
- Efficiently supports lossy compression suited for web images (by using the VP8 codec).

### Structure
- **RIFF Header:** Identifies the file as being in RIFF format (`RIFF` followed by file size).
- **WEBP Header:** Indicates the image type (`WEBP`).
- **VP8 Data Block:** Contains encoding data for the actual image, compressed.

### Usage
- **Input:** Used as a resource file (not meant to be read as source code).
- **Output:** Intended to be opened/decoded by image viewers, web browsers, or libraries supporting WebP images.

### Typical Applications
- Displaying images on the web with improved compression compared to JPEG/PNG.
- Embedding images in websites, documents, or within multimedia assets.

### Notes
- **Not executable code.**
- Cannot be interpreted as a script or program.
- If intending editing or viewing, use an image viewer or an image processing tool (e.g., Photoshop, GIMP, browser plugins).

**In summary:**  
This artifact is a WebP image file containing binary-encoded image data, not a source code file or program. It is suited for web graphics applications where efficient image storage and transmission are desired.
