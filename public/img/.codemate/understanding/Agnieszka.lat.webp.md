# High-Level Documentation

This file is a **binary WebP image file** rather than source code. WebP is an image format developed by Google that supports both lossless and lossy compression. The content consists of the encoded image data (not human-readable code or script). 

## Key Points:

- **File Format**: `WEBP` (RIFF container with a VP8/VP8L chunk - the actual image data).
- **Purpose**: To efficiently store and transfer images, typically for static photos or graphics on the web.
- **Contents**: Binary data encoding image pixel values, color information, and possibly metadata, using the WebP specification.
- **Not Source Code**: No logical flow or programming structure â€” it is not meant to be interpreted as code.

## Usage

To view or use the image:
- Save this data with a `.webp` extension.
- Open it with any image viewer that supports WebP (modern browsers, image viewers, or editing tools).

## Summary

**This file is a WebP image. It serves as a compact, optimized means to store and transfer raster images on digital platforms.**
