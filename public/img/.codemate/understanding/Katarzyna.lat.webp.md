### Overview

This file is a **binary WebP image file**. The WebP format is a modern image format that provides both lossless and lossy compression for images on the web. The file begins with the standard `RIFF` header and specifies the format as `WEBP`, followed by image data encoded in the VP8 or VP8L codec.

---

### Purpose

The primary purpose of this file is to store a raster image in the efficient and widely-used WebP format. This format is commonly used on the web to reduce image file sizes while maintaining high visual quality.

---

### File Structure

- **Header**
  - `RIFF` - Resource Interchange File Format identifier.
  - File size - The next 4 bytes after `RIFF` denote the file size.
  - `WEBP` - Specifies that the file is a WebP image.
  - `VP8 ` or `VP8L` or `VP8X` chunk - This chunk defines the encoding used for the image data.
    - `VP8 `: Lossy bitstream
    - `VP8L`: Lossless bitstream
    - `VP8X`: Extended format

- **Image Data**
  - The remainder of the file is encoded image data, which may include:
    - Pixel data (compressed)
    - Metadata (EXIF, XMP, etc.) - optional
    - Alpha channel (transparency) - optional, if present

---

### Functionality

This WebP file is intended to be:

- **Loaded by web browsers** or compatible image libraries.
- **Displayed as an image** wherever it is referenced (for example, on a website or in an app).
- **Transcoded or converted** to other image formats using tools like ImageMagick or ffmpeg if needed.

---

### Usage

You do **not** interact with or execute the file as code. Instead, it is referenced as an asset:

- Embedded in HTML as an `<img src="...">`
- Used as a CSS background
- Opened or previewed in image viewers/editors
- Processed by image libraries (e.g., Pillow, libwebp)

---

### Security/Editing

- This file is **not source code** and does not contain logic or executable data.
- To modify, use an **image editing tool** that supports WebP (e.g., Photoshop, GIMP, online converters).

### Summary

**This file is a WebP image, stored in binary format according to the WebP image specification, and is meant for graphical display or inclusion as a media asset.**
